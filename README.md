# AnkitDryfruits

##### I have created this e-commerce website using Bootstrap, Font Awesome Icons, Animate.css, whatsapp api and JavaScript. It is made using built in functions in Javascript and Javascript HTML DOM mainly.

- I have created object of elements - In that way Admin just have to add element to object and it will be displayed in frontend
- Then for every validated item added to cart it's id and quantity will be added to array
- Based on items in array cart is built and total and cart-total is calculated
- https://wa.me/${number}/?text=${message} api link used to send order details on whatsapp
