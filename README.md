# AnkitDryfruits

## I have created this e-commerce website using Bootstrap, Font Awesome Icons, Animate.css and JavaScript.
## I used some built in functions in Javascript and Javascript HTML DOM.

### I have created object of elements - In that way Admin just have to add element to object and it will be displayed in frontend
### Then for every validated item added to cart it's id and quantity will be added to array
### based on item in array cart is built and total and cart-total is calculated
### https://wa.me/${number}/?text=${message} link used to send order details on whatsapp
